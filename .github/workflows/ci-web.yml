      # Web workflow placeholder.
      # Detailed web-client tests (linting, builds, unit tests, and dependency installs)
      # will be introduced during the Adamantine v0.3 implementation phase.
      # For v0.2 architecture, this workflow validates that the web client structure exists
      # and can be inspected safely in CI without causing failures.
