# 🌌 Overview

**DigiByte Adamantine Wallet OS** is not a traditional cryptocurrency wallet.  
It is a **full Wallet Operating System (Wallet-OS)** designed to unify:

- Multi-client DigiByte wallet (Android, iOS, Web)  
- DigiAssets v3 engine  
- DigiDollar minting module  
- Q-ID (PQC identity system)  
- Guardian Wallet (User Protection Layer)  
- Quantum Wallet Guard (QWG)  
- Shield Bridge (Sentinel → DQSN → ADN → QWG → Guardian)  
- Adaptive Core v2 (Learning, Fusion & Signal Correlation)  
- Enigmatic Layer-0 communications  
- Node integration (local + DigiMobile)  
- Risk Engine  
- Telemetry  
- End-to-end test layers  
- **EQC (Equilibrium Confirmation)** — deterministic decision layer  
- **WSQK (Wallet-Scoped Quantum Key)** — scoped execution authority  

Adamantine Wallet OS is built to serve as the **primary gateway** for DigiByte’s next era:  
quantum-resistant, modular, secure, intelligent, and entirely open-source.

## 🔗 External MIT Modules Acknowledgment

Adamantine does **not** reimplement or claim ownership of external DigiByte community projects.  
It provides clean integration layers for existing MIT-licensed modules, including:

- **Enigmatic (Layer-0 messaging)** — created by @JohnnyLaw  
- **DigiMobile / Node tools** — also created by @JohnnyLaw  

Adamantine uses *adapters* to connect with these systems when they are available.  
All credit for the underlying protocols belongs to their original authors.  
Adamantine’s architecture simply enables them to work together within a unified Wallet-OS.

# 🧱 Architecture Summary

Adamantine Wallet OS is structured as:

```
DigiByte-Adamantine-Wallet-OS/
│
├── clients/               # Android, iOS, Web clients (UI & app logic)
├── core/                  # Wallet engine, EQC, WSQK, shield bridge, assets
├── modules/               # DigiDollar, DigiAssets, Enigmatic, telemetry, integrations
├── docs/                  # Full whitepapers for each subsystem
├── config/                # Guardian rules, network parameters
├── tests/                 # End-to-end and unit tests
└── .github/workflows/     # CI for Android • iOS • Web • Docs
```

Each subsystem is completely modular, versioned, explainable, and independently testable.

# 🔐 Core Security Architecture (EQC + WSQK)

Adamantine enforces an OS-level security invariant:

> **EQC decides. WSQK executes. Runtime enforces.**

There is no bypass path.

### 🔹 EQC — Equilibrium Confirmation

EQC is the **deterministic decision engine** of Adamantine Wallet OS.

It:
- evaluates an immutable execution context  
- runs classifiers and explicit policy rules  
- returns a final verdict (`ALLOW`, `DENY`, `STEP_UP`)  

EQC:
- has no side effects  
- does not sign  
- does not generate keys  
- does not execute actions  

EQC produces:
- a verdict  
- a context hash  
- a signal bundle  

### 🔹 WSQK — Wallet-Scoped Quantum Key

WSQK defines **execution authority** after EQC approval.

WSQK authority is:
- scoped to a wallet and specific action  
- bound to an EQC-approved context hash  
- time-limited (TTL)  
- single-use (nonce enforced)  
- non-reusable across contexts  

There is no static private key to steal.

### 🔹 Runtime Enforcement

A runtime orchestrator guarantees:

- EQC is always evaluated first  
- WSQK cannot be reached without `ALLOW`  
- execution is blocked otherwise  

All invariants are enforced in code and locked by CI tests.

# 🛡️ Adamantine & The DigiByte Quantum Shield

Adamantine is the **only DigiByte wallet** designed to deeply integrate all 5 layers of the Shield:

```
   Sentinel AI v2        (Anomaly Detection)
   DQSN v2               (Network Health & Entropy)
   ADN v2                (Active Defence Playbooks)
   QWG                   (User-Side Transaction Guard)
   Guardian Wallet       (User Warnings & Protection)
   Adaptive Core v2      (Learning & Fusion)
                ↓
     Adamantine Wallet OS (Final Execution Layer)
```

Adamantine is where **all shield intelligence becomes real protection**.

# 🧬 Wallet OS: Core Philosophy

Adamantine is built on six principles:

1. **Quantum Security First** — PQC-ready architecture via Q-ID, QWG, and WSQK.  
2. **Explainability** — every decision (including EQC verdicts) is deterministic and auditable.  
3. **Modularity** — each subsystem is isolated and upgrade-ready.  
4. **Multi-Client Parity** — Android, iOS, and Web behave identically.  
5. **Separation of Concerns** — decision (EQC), authority (WSQK), and execution are isolated.  
6. **Consensus-Neutrality** — Adamantine never changes DigiByte consensus rules.

# 📱 Clients (Android • iOS • Web)

```
clients/
├── android/
├── ios/
└── web/
```

Each client receives:

- wallet engine API  
- UI screens  
- Shield & Guardian integration  
- DigiAssets v3 rendering  
- DigiDollar minting UX  
- Node selection via Node Manager  
- PQC identity hooks for Q-ID  
- EQC-driven decision feedback  

The wallet OS layer guarantees identical behaviour across all three environments.

The architecture focuses on:
- Local-first enforcement and user sovereignty  
- Layered defense against user error, malware, and manipulation  
- Optional network intelligence without centralization  
- Safe failure behavior under uncertainty or offline conditions
