## 🛡️ What Is Adamantine?

The **DigiByte Adamantine Wallet** is the first wallet designed as a complete **defensive architecture**, integrating:

- **Guardian Wallet** (next-gen rule-based protection)
- **Quantum Wallet Guard (QWG)**
- **DigiAssets Engine (v3 architecture)**
- **DigiDollar (DD) minting**
- **Enigmatic Layer-0 Messaging** (JohnnyLaw)
- **Adaptive Core** (self-learning immune system)
- **5-Layer DigiByte Quantum Shield Network**  
  **Sentinel → DQSN → ADN → QWG → Adaptive Core**

Adamantine is not “just a wallet.”  
It is a **security operating system** for DigiByte.

---

## ✨ Vision

To create the most **secure**, **self-healing**, **multi-asset**, **multi-client** DigiByte wallet ever developed.

This project is built for:

- everyday users  
- developers  
- advanced power users  
- guardians  
- institutions seeking future-proof blockchain security  

All of it is **open-source (MIT)** and multi-platform.

---

## 🔥 Why Adamantine Is Unique

### **1. Quantum-Resistant Security**
Security is not a plugin. It is the architecture.

Integrated with the full **DigiByte Quantum Shield**:

- **Sentinel AI**: node drift + anomaly detection  
- **DQSN v2**: distributed confirmations & attestation  
- **ADN v2**: autonomous defense and lockdown  
- **QWG**: wallet-level post-quantum threat blocking  
- **Adaptive Core**: machine-learned immune system that strengthens with every attack  

---

### **2. Guardian Wallet — Human + Machine Safety Layer**

Guardian Wallet introduces programmable safety rules:

- Approvals for high-value transactions  
- Multi-guardian protection  
- Device-binding rules  
- Minting restrictions  
- Settings-change protection  

A modern, intelligent evolution of wallet security.

---

### **3. DigiAssets Engine (v3)**

Adamantine includes a fully modular DigiAssets system:

- asset parsing  
- asset indexing  
- transfer rules  
- burn rules  
- minting rules  
- metadata schema validation  

Designed to be future-proof, with clean module separation.

---

### **4. DigiDollar (DD) Minting Engine**

The world’s first wallet with **native DigiDollar minting**:

- guardian-secured mints  
- metadata schema validation  
- per-mint and total supply caps  
- rule-driven minting policies  

---

### **5. Enigmatic Layer-0 Messaging (JohnnyLaw)**

Adamantine integrates directly with **Enigmatic**, a Layer-0 protocol using DigiByte UTXOs as communication planes.

This enables:

- wallet-to-wallet messaging  
- payment requests  
- encrypted structured intents  
- Zero-trust communication without third-party servers  

---

### **6. Multi-Client Architecture**

Adamantine provides a unified foundation for:

- **Web (PWA)**  
- **Android**  
- **iOS**  

All three clients share the same core logic via structured bindings.

---

### **7. Modular Core Layout**

```
core/
  digiassets/
  guardian-wallet/
  risk-engine/
  pqc-containers/
  qwg/
  shield-bridge/
  data-models/
```

Every module is isolated, documented, and testable.
