# Adamantine Wallet — Development Roadmap (2025–2027)
Status: **draft v0.1**

This roadmap outlines the phased development of the **DigiByte Adamantine Wallet**, 
including DigiAssets, DigiDollar, Enigmatic Layer‑0 messaging, and full integration 
with the DigiByte Quantum Shield Network.

It is divided into clear milestones from MVP → Beta → v1.0 → long‑term evolution.
